    "\n",
    "A good part of the project consists in finding information through\n",
    "of API. In this section, we see what APIs are and how they work.\n",
    "use them with the *requests* library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It is actually\n",
    "a set of instructions that the designers of an application (whether local or online) made available to other programmers who would like to use their application through code-based interactions (i.e. without going through the GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many APIs for a whole bunch of sites or applications. For the project, you will need to use the coinpaprika and twitter API. For\n",
    "using the first API, we can use a very powerful library of\n",
    "who just makes a call to the site and gets an answer. For the Twitter API, the fact that you have to identify yourself makes the process more\n",
    "complex and, for this reason, we will use a library that manages\n",
    "most of the authentication details for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a video that explains what a web API is (there are also\n",
    "Local APIs, but we won't see them in this course). *The company that produced this video sells integration solutions, so the last part of the video is largely an ad but the video is\n",
    "instructive if you've never used an API before.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The Game of Thrones API\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an API, you usually need to know what you want to\n",
    "recover. During this session, and because it's in season, we're going to\n",
    "use an API that allows us to access information about [Game of Thrones characters and their h](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)ouses. In this saga, characters from several families (called\n",
    "houses) compete to become the Queen or King of the 7 Kingdoms, and\n",
    "govern Westeros. Dragons are also part of the picture. *If you have a worse way of describing it, let me know *.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of API may seem a bit pointless as it is. However, it is\n",
    "possible to couple this API with others and to program a little to get [this kind of result](https://got.show/) - a predictive model giving the likelihood that each character will die in the last season (a project from the Munich Technical University).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, after identifying the API you want to use is to read the documentation. Fortunately, in the case of the API for\n",
    "GoT (we will use this abbreviation for Games of Thrones in the\n",
    "rest of this notebook), it's pretty simple. The documentation can be\n",
    "can be found [on this page](https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "On this page you can find some important information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will not be able to receive information from more than 50 characters or houses per API call.\n",
    "2. There are two interesting \"features\" for us\n",
    "    - The one that lists the characters ([https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters](https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters) + options)\n",
    "    - The one that lists the houses ([https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses](https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses) + options)\n",
